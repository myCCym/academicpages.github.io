Hi! I am Mingyu CHEN (陈鸣宇). I am a senior year undergraduate of [HUST](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), majoring in Telecommunication. My research interests include optimization, multi-agents system and distributed computing. In particular, I am interested in therotical designs that allow edge devices to complete workload in a distributed manner, achieve lower computation/communication latency and provide high-quality service. I am also interested in problems corresponding to game therot such as auction and pricing model to optimize distributed network.

Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my bachelor's degree of Engineering from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering.

Always open to research interns and cooperation opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested. My email address is huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn.

Currently, we are looking for **research assistants and visiting students for MiLAB**. More information about requirements for research assistants [here](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1301/5559.htm), and if you are still in school, being a visiting student is also welcome. Please send email to `mi_lab [at] westlake.edu.cn` with your CV if you are interested. Specially, if you are interested in my research direction and would like to be my collaborator after coming, please let us know it from the email.
