Hi! I am Mingyu CHEN (陈鸣宇). I am a senior year undergraduate of [HUST](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), majoring in Telecommunication. My research interests include optimization, multi-agents system and distributed computing. In particular, I am interested in therotical designs that allow edge devices to complete workload in a distributed manner, achieve lower computation and communication latency and provide high-quality service. I am also interested in problems corresponding to game theroy and mechanism designs such as auction and pricing model to optimize distributed network.

**I am looking for Research Assistant position. Free to contact me if you are interested in my works!!!**
